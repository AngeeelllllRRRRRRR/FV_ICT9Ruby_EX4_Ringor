  <h2>About The Series</h2>
  <p>A camping trip to mysterious Mako Island turns out to be much more than that for outdoorsy teen Zac. Unknown to him, the island is actually the domain of a pod of mermaids, three of whom -- Sirena, Nixie and Lyla -- should be guarding the Moon Pool. But they neglect their duties, and Zac falls in. The waters of the pool endow Zac with special powers, allowing him to transform into a merman when he comes into contact with water and forcing the mermaid pod to leave the waters around the island. Not all of them leave, however; the three transgressors are cast out of the pod and left behind. To rejoin their community, the girls must somehow travel on land and retrieve Zac's new powers. If they fail, they'll remain outcasts forever. Zac enjoys his newfound abilities, and the girls are sympathetic. What's a mermaid to do?</p><br>

      </h2><br>
      <p style="text-align: justify-all;">Nixie appears in Season 1, along with Lyla and Sirena. In Outcasts, they are cast out of the Southern Pod for letting a land boy, Zac Blakely, into the Moon Pool while they were supposed to be keeping watch. This results in Zac becoming a merman, which in turn results in the Pod leaving Mako, without Nixie, Sirena, and Lyla.</p>

	<p>Throughout the season, she, along with Lyla and Sirena, attempt to take away Zac's merman powers to make Mako safe for the Pod to return.</p>

	<p>Ondina is a mermaid from the Mako Island pod who decides that she and Mimmi must go against the mermaid council's rules and run away to drain Zac of his powers.

        Sirena
      </h2><br>
      <p style="text-align: justify-all;">Sirena grew up in the Mako Pod, and has been Nixie's best friend since they were hatchlings. She is very close to her sister Aquata and is very upset when she and the pod left her, Lyla and Nixie by themselves on Mako to sort things out. She strongly desires to find a way to remove Zac's powers so that she and the other can return to the pod, reunite with her sister, and things can go back to the way they were. During this time however, she finds a love interest in a boy named David. They both develop clearly strong feelings for each other and eventually become a couple.</p>
